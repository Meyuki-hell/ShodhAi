## Problem Statement 2 (Required for ML Applications) :
Task: 
Implement a Neural Network for a Logic Gate or MNIST Dataset and Create a Visualisation

Objective:
Implement a neural network that performs the function of a logic gate (AND, OR, etc.) or works on the MNIST dataset and creates a visualisation similar to TensorFlow Playground. This task will test your understanding of neural network implementation, PyTorch, and visualisation techniques.

 Instructions:

 Part 1: Neural Network Implementation

1.  Choose a Task :
   -  Option A : Implement a neural network for a logic gate (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).
   -  Option B : Implement a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

2.  Implement the Neural Network :
   -  For Logic Gate :
     - Define a simple neural network model using PyTorch that can learn the logic gate function.
     - Prepare the dataset for the chosen logic gate.
     - Train the model and ensure it correctly predicts the output of the logic gate.
   -  For MNIST :
     - Define a neural network model using PyTorch for classifying digits from the MNIST dataset.
     - Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
     - Train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data.

3.  Training and Evaluation :
   - Define an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
   - Train the model and ensure it achieves satisfactory performance.
   - Evaluate the model and report the accuracy or other relevant metrics.

 Part 2: Visualisation

1.  Create a Visualisation Interface :
   - Design a visualisation similar to TensorFlow Playground that allows users to interact with the neural network model.
   - The interface should enable users to see how changes in hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden units) affect the model’s performance.

2.  Visualisation Features :
   -  For Logic Gate :
     - Visualise the decision boundary learned by the model.
     - Allow users to input different logical conditions and see the model’s predictions.

   -  For MNIST :
     - Visualise the weights of the first layer and how they change during training.
     - Provide a way to input custom digit images and see the model’s predictions.

3.  Implementation :
   - Use a suitable visualisation library or tool (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly, Gradio) to create the interactive visualisation.
   - Ensure the visualisation is user-friendly and informative.

 Deliverables:
-  Code :
  - PyTorch code for defining, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
  - Code for creating the interactive visualisation interface.

-  Documentation :
  - A brief report explaining the model architecture, training process, and results.
  - Instructions on how to use the visualisation interface.

-  Visualisation :
  - A link or notebook demonstrating the interactive visualisation.
